## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
  What is the target audience. I think it's pretty crucial to know what the audience is when building a project. It helps to understand who we're targeting so that we could have a proper approach for the issues.

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
  As a user, I can view the job market/outlook for the city:
  - Collecting data about salary, jobs opportunities, reviews, companies, interviews about jobs
  - Merge into API with weather/rent
  - Create and style graphical components, icons, cards components
  - Display prominently median salary and top industry
  - Pie chart (donut chart) of top industries
  As a user, I can see the typical weather pattearns for the city:
  - Collecting data about average temperature, humidity and precipitation, air quality.
  - Create and style dynamic current weather icon
  - Create and style button components, average weather data within that month/week
  - Toggle option on fahrenheit and celsius
  As a user, I can view the historical housing prices/rent of a city:
  - Create wireframes
  - Map housing data from zillow API to cities in database
  - Create enpoint to retreive housing data given cityID
  - Create and style bar chart / line graph component
  - Rendering data to serve front end purpose

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
  For a user to see historical housing prices would be really interesting. I never had a chance to work with data type like that before so it'll be really interesting to see how DS engineers on our team come up with those data

    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    Knowing what we have to work with and who our audience is, I think it helps a lot in term of breaking down what we need to do research on. Since we're working with data, any kind of charts or graph would be really awesome if implemented and I don't have much experience with any of them so I think that'll be a challenge

4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
  I think one of the key thing to approach the product is to understanding what problem the product is trying to solve as well as knowing who our audience is. I think our team did a pretty good job at breaking down the objectives, asking the right questions and communicating with each other.
